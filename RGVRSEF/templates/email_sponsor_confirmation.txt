Your Unique ID: {{ sponsor.id|encode }}

This year, in order to simplify student registration, we
have introduced this Unique ID. Each sponsor has a Unique ID
through which we are able to tie student and sponsor
together during registration.

To do this, we need you to provide all registering students
with this Unique ID. Please note that this Unique ID is case
sensitive (meaning that capitalization matters).

If you have any questions or concerns, do not hesitate to
contact us via email at {{ contact.email }} or by phone at
{{ contact.phone }}.

Again, thank you for participating in the 2012 RGV Regional
Science and Engineering Fair.
